# Visualising Flight-Delays-and-Cancellations using Tableau 
Udacity Data Analyst - Project III
## summary
This project consists of building visualization dashboards using Tableau. Corresponding data sets document a variety of airline information including delays, cancellations, dates, and destinations. Data set from 2015 for major airlines and airports.
The goal of the dashboards is to visualize which airlines have the most number of delays and possible causes. This information can be useful in improving airlines, which can lead to improvements in their branding and customer experience/satisfaction.
## Answering Questions: 
Questions can be answered by visualizing data in Tableau:
- What is the best airline to travel on to avoid big delays?
- Which airlines and airports have the worst delays during the months?
- What is the geographical location of the number of canceled flights?
### The data visualization in Tableau can be found in the attached "project report".
